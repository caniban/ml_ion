WARNING: HERE, WE PRESENT ONLY DECISION TREE REGRESSION IN ORDER TO SUBMIT A BRIEF AND PLAIN CODE
THE PREDICTIONS AND OTHER CALCULATIONS CAN BE ALSO DONE FOR RANDOM FOREST AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE REGRESSORS BY CHANGING THE VARIABLE OF REGRESSOR (regrSVR AND regRF)
YOU CAN ALSO CHANGE THE LABELS AND EXPORTED FILE NAMES DEPENDING ON YOUR REGRESSOR SELECTION.
